## 💻 Step 5: Update Your Code

### 5.1 Update App ID in index.html

Current App ID in your `index.html`: `1148870030057645`

Replace it with your new App ID:

```html
<script>
  window.fbAsyncInit = function () {
    FB.init({
      appId: "YOUR_NEW_APP_ID", // Replace this
      cookie: true,
      xfbml: true,
      version: "v24.0",
    });
  };
</script>
```

### 5.2 Update Permissions Scope

Update the scope in your component to include all permissions:

```typescript
scope: "email,business_management,leads_retrieval,pages_show_list,pages_read_engagement,pages_manage_ads,pages_manage_metadata";
```

## 🔍 Step 6: Testing Strategy

## 🧰 Step 8: Development Tips

### Use Test Pages

1. Create a test Facebook Page
2. Create test Lead Ads
3. Submit test lead forms yourself

### Error Handling

Common errors during testing:

- **Error 200**: Permission denied - User hasn't granted permission
- **Error 190**: Access token expired - Refresh the token
- **Error 100**: Invalid parameter - Check API version compatibility
- **Error 10**: Permission not granted - User or app lacks permission

### Token Management

- **User Access Token**: Short-lived (1-2 hours)
- **Page Access Token**: Can be long-lived (60 days+)
- **Never commit tokens** to your repository

---

## 📊 Step 9: Monitoring & Maintenance

### Set Up Webhooks (Optional)

For real-time lead notifications:

1. Go to **Products > Webhooks**
2. Subscribe to `leadgen` events
3. Configure callback URL
4. Implement webhook handler in your backend

### Monitor API Usage

1. Check **Analytics** dashboard
2. Monitor rate limits
3. Track errors in **Error Reports**

---

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### 1. Never Expose App Secret

- Keep it in environment variables
- Never commit to Git
- Use server-side authentication when possible

### 2. Validate Tokens

- Always verify tokens server-side
- Check token expiration
- Validate permissions match expected scope

### 3. Handle User Data Responsibly

- Store only necessary data
- Encrypt sensitive information
- Implement data deletion on user request
- Comply with GDPR/privacy regulations

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Immediate** (Before App Review):

   - ✅ Update App ID if you created a new app
   - ✅ Test basic email authentication (already working!)
   - Create privacy policy
   - Create terms of service
   - Record demo video

2. **Short Term** (Submit for Review):

   - Complete business verification
   - Submit permission requests with documentation
   - Wait for approval (3-7 days)

3. **After Approval**:
   - Update permissions scope in code
   - Test with real users
   - Implement full lead import flow
   - Set up webhooks for real-time sync
   - Monitor and optimize

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start with Standard Access**: Begin testing with your own account before requesting advanced permissions

2. **Document Everything**: Keep screenshots and notes of your implementation for the App Review

3. **Use Webhooks**: For production, implement webhooks instead of polling for new leads

4. **Cache Page Tokens**: Store long-lived Page access tokens to avoid re-authentication

5. **Handle Revocations**: Users can revoke permissions - handle gracefully

6. **Test Edge Cases**:
   - User with no Pages
   - Page with no lead forms
   - Expired tokens
   - Network failures

Good luck with your Facebook App setup! 🚀
