# 🔒 Fix: Secure Connection Required for Facebook Login

## The Error

```
Facebook has detected OceanCRM Lead Importv1 isn't using a secure connection to transfer information.
Until OceanCRM Lead Importv1 updates its security settings, you won't be able to use Facebook to log into it.
```

## ✅ Yes, You Can Test on Localhost!

Facebook **does allow** `localhost` for testing without HTTPS. The issue is with your OAuth configuration.

---

## 🛠️ Quick Fix (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Check Your Facebook App Settings

Go to your Facebook App Dashboard:
**https://developers.facebook.com/apps/{YOUR_APP_ID}/settings/basic/**

### Step 2: Verify App Domains

In **"App Domains"** field, add:

```
localhost
```

**Important**: Do NOT include `http://` or port numbers here!

### Step 3: Configure OAuth Redirect URIs

Go to: **Facebook Login → Settings**

**URL**: https://developers.facebook.com/apps/{YOUR_APP_ID}/fb-login/settings/

Add these **Valid OAuth Redirect URIs**:

```
http://localhost:5173/
http://localhost:5173
http://127.0.0.1:5173/
http://127.0.0.1:5173
```

**Important Notes**:

- ✅ Use `http://` (not `https://`) for localhost
- ✅ Include trailing slash `/` as a separate entry
- ✅ Add both `localhost` and `127.0.0.1`
- ✅ Make sure port matches your dev server (default: 5173 for Vite)

### Step 4: Save Changes

Click **"Save Changes"** button at the bottom of the page.

### Step 5: Wait & Test

1. Wait 5 minutes for changes to propagate
2. Clear browser cache or use incognito mode
3. Restart your dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Try Facebook login again

1. Go to: https://developers.facebook.com/apps/
2. Click on your app name
3. App ID is shown at the top of the dashboard
4. Or check your `index.html` file - it's in the `FB.init()` code

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Given URL is not permitted by the application configuration"

**Cause**: OAuth redirect URI not configured correctly

**Solution**:

1. Check spelling of `localhost` (no spaces)
2. Make sure using `http://` not `https://`
3. Include trailing slash as separate entry
4. Match exact port number (5173 is Vite default)

### Issue 2: Still getting security error after configuration

**Solutions**:

1. **Clear browser cache**: Ctrl+Shift+Delete
2. **Use incognito mode**: Test without cache
3. **Wait 5-10 minutes**: Facebook needs time to propagate changes
4. **Restart dev server**: `Ctrl+C` then `npm run dev`
5. **Check you're using correct URL**: Verify `http://localhost:5173` in browser

### Issue 3: "App not setup: This app is still in development mode"

**This is NORMAL!** It means:

- ✅ Your configuration is correct
- ✅ You can test with your account (if you're an admin)
- ⚠️ Other users can't use it until you submit for App Review

**Solution**: Make sure your Facebook account is added as Admin/Developer in the app.

### Issue 4: Different port number

If your app runs on a different port (e.g., 3000, 8080):

**Find your port**:

```bash
# Look at terminal output when running:
npm run dev

# You'll see something like:
# Local: http://localhost:5173/
```

**Update OAuth settings** with your actual port:

```
http://localhost:YOUR_PORT/
```

## 🔐 Why Localhost Works Without HTTPS

Facebook makes a **special exception** for localhost:

- ✅ `http://localhost` is allowed for testing
- ✅ `http://127.0.0.1` is allowed for testing
- ❌ `http://your-domain.com` requires HTTPS
- ❌ Production apps MUST use HTTPS

**This is by design** to make local development easier!

## 📝 Step-by-Step Configuration Script

Copy these URLs and configure them in Facebook:

### 1. Go to Basic Settings

```
https://developers.facebook.com/apps/{YOUR_APP_ID}/settings/basic/
```

**Add to "App Domains"**:

```
localhost
```

### 2. Go to Facebook Login Settings

```
https://developers.facebook.com/apps/{YOUR_APP_ID}/fb-login/settings/
```

**Add to "Valid OAuth Redirect URIs"** (click "Add URI" for each):

```
http://localhost:5173/
http://localhost:5173
http://127.0.0.1:5173/
http://127.0.0.1:5173
```

**Add to "Allowed Domains for the JavaScript SDK"**:

```
localhost
127.0.0.1
```

### 3. Save All Changes

Click **"Save Changes"** at the bottom.

## 🧪 Test Your Configuration

### Method 1: Quick Test

1. Open: http://localhost:5173
2. Go to Leads page
3. Click "Import from Facebook"
4. Click "Log in With Facebook"
5. Should see Facebook login popup ✅

### Method 2: Check Browser Console

1. Open browser DevTools (F12)

2. Try to generate a test token
3. If token generates, configuration is correct

---

## 💻 Update Your Code (Optional)

Your current setup should work, but to be extra safe, verify your `index.html`:

### Check index.html

```html
<script>
  window.fbAsyncInit = function () {
    FB.init({
      appId: "YOUR_APP_ID", // Make sure this matches your Facebook App
      cookie: true,
      xfbml: true,
      version: "v24.0",
    });
  };

  (function (d, s, id) {
    var js,
      fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];
    if (d.getElementById(id)) {
      return;
    }
    js = d.createElement(s);
    js.id = id;
    js.src = "https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js";
    fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);
  })(document, "script", "facebook-jssdk");
</script>
```

**Important**: Make sure `appId` matches your Facebook App ID exactly!

## 🚀 Production Deployment (Later)

When deploying to production, you'll need:

### 1. HTTPS Certificate

- Use Netlify (free HTTPS)
- Use Vercel (free HTTPS)
- Use Let's Encrypt (free certificate)
- Or your hosting provider's SSL

### 2. Update Facebook App Settings

Add your production URLs:

**App Domains**:

```
yourdomain.com
```

**OAuth Redirect URIs**:

```
https://yourdomain.com/
https://yourdomain.com
```

**JavaScript SDK Domains**:

```
yourdomain.com
```

### 3. Keep Localhost Settings

You can keep both localhost AND production URLs configured at the same time!

## 🆘 Still Not Working?

### Check These:

   # Check what port your app actually uses:
   npm run dev
   # Look for: Local: http://localhost:XXXX/
   ```

2. **Browser Console Errors**:

   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Look for red error messages
   - Copy error message and search it

3. **Facebook App Status**:

   - Check app is in Development mode
   - Check you're logged into correct Facebook account

4. **Try Different Browser**:

   - Chrome incognito
   - Firefox private window
   - Edge private window

5. **Check Internet Connection**:
   - Facebook SDK needs to load
   - Check no firewall blocking Facebook
